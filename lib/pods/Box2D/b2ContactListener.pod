=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implement this class to get contact information. You can use these
results for things like sounds and game logic. You can also get contact
results by traversing the contact lists after the time step. However,
you might miss some contacts because continuous physics leads to
sub-stepping. Additionally you may receive multiple callbacks for the
same contact in a single time step. You should strive to make your
callbacks efficient because there may be many callbacks per time step.

Warning: You cannot create/destroy C<Box2D> entities inside these
callbacks.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Creates and returns a new C<Box2D::b2ContactListener>. This is an
inheritance friendly sub so you're free to leave it as default. Remember
to call super in your own code, don't forget to call this!

Returns a C<Box2D::b2ContactListener>

=head2 BeginContact( $contact )

Called when two fixtures begin to touch.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<Box2D::b2Contact> C<$contact>

=back

=head2 EndContact( $contact )

Called when two fixtures cease to touch.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<Box2D::b2Contact> C<$contact>

=back

=head2 PreSolve( $contact, $manifold )

This is called after a contact is updated. This allows you to inspect a
contact before it goes to the solver. If you are careful, you can modify
the contact manifold (e.g. disable contact). A copy of the old manifold
is provided so that you can detect changes.

Note: this is called only for awake bodies.

Note: this is called even when the number of contact points is zero.

Note: this is not called for sensors.

Note: if you set the number of contact points to zero, you will not get
an C<EndContact> callback. However, you may get a C<BeginContact>
callback the next step.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<Box2D::b2Contact> C<$contact>

=item * C<Box2D::b2Manifold> C<$manifold>

=back

=head2 PostSolve( $contact, $impulse )

This lets you inspect a contact after the solver is finished. This is
useful for inspecting impulses.

Note: the contact manifold does not include time of impact impulses,
which can be arbitrarily large if the sub-step is small. Hence the
impulse is provided explicitly in a separate data structure.

Note: this is only called for contacts that are touching, solid, and
awake.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<Box2D::b2Contact> C<$contact>

=item * C<Box2D::b2ContactImpulse> C<$impulse>

=back

=head2 setOurListeners()

This is private don't bother calling it unless you inherit and need to
initialize.

Note: C<< $self->{_listener} >> needs to be a
C<Box2D::PerlContactListener>.
