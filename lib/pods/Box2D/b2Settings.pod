=head1 NAME

Box2D::b2Settings - Global constants based on meters-kilograms-seconds (MKS) units

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # get the maximum number of vertices on a convex polygon.
 my $max_polygon_vertices = Box2D::maxPolygonVertices;

 # get libBox2D's version
 my $version = Box2D::b2_version;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These methods are compile-time values of the C++ library Box2D. They can not be changed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 b2_version

 my $version = Box2D::b2Settings::b2_version;

 # will print something like "2.2.1"
 printf( "%d.%d.%d", $version->major, $version->minor, $version->revision );

Returns a L<Box2D::b2Version> object holding the current C++ library Box2D version.

B<Note:> This is not the Box2D-perl version.
This is found in C<$Box2D::VERSION>.

=head2 b2_maxFloat

The value of this is the maximum number representable in type float. It is supposed to be
at least 1E+37. The value has type float. The smallest representable number is - FLT_MAX.

=head2 b2_epsilon

This is the minimum positive floating point number of type float such that 1.0 + FLT_EPSILON
!= 1.0 is true. It's supposed to be no greater than 1E-5.

=head2 b2_pi

Gives you the value of pi.

=head2 b2_maxManifoldPoints

The maximum number of contact points between two convex shapes.

=head2 b2_maxPolygonVertices

The maximum number of vertices on a convex polygon.

=head2 b2_aabbExtension

This is used to fatten AABBs in the dynamic tree. This allows proxies
to move by a small amount without triggering a tree adjustment.
This is in meters.

=head2 b2_aabbMultiplier

This is used to fatten AABBs in the dynamic tree. This is used to predict
the future position based on the current displacement.
This is a dimensionless multiplier.

=head2 b2_linearSlop

A small length used as a collision and constraint tolerance. Usually it is
chosen to be numerically significant, but visually insignificant.

=head2 b2_angularSlop

A small angle used as a collision and constraint tolerance. Usually it is
chosen to be numerically significant, but visually insignificant.

=head2 b2_polygonRadius

The radius of the polygon/edge shape skin.

=head2 b2_maxSubSteps

Maximum number of sub-steps per contact in continuous physics simulation.

=head2 b2_maxTOIContacts

Maximum number of contacts to be handled to solve a TOI impact.

=head2 b2_velocityThreshold

A velocity threshold for elastic collisions. Any collision with a relative linear
velocity below this threshold will be treated as inelastic.

=head2 b2_maxLinearCorrection

The maximum linear position correction used when solving constraints. This helps to
prevent overshoot.

=head2 b2_maxAngularCorrection

The maximum angular position correction used when solving constraints. This helps to
prevent overshoot.

=head2 b2_maxTranslation

=head2 b2_maxTranslationSquared

The maximum linear velocity of a body. This limit is very large and is used
to prevent numerical problems.

=head2 b2_maxRotation

=head2 b2_maxRotationSquared

The maximum angular velocity of a body. This limit is very large and is used
to prevent numerical problems.

=head2 b2_baumgarte

=head2 b2_toiBaugarte

This scale factor controls how fast overlap is resolved.

=head2 b2_timeToSleep

The time that a body must be still before it will go to sleep.

=head2 b2_linearSleepTolerance

A body cannot sleep if its linear velocity is above this tolerance.

=head2 b2_angularSleepTolerance

A body cannot sleep if its angular velocity is above this tolerance.
