=head1 NAME

Box2D::b2Vec2 - A 2D column vector

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # create a new vector representing the gravity
 my $gravity = Box2D::b2Vec2->new( 0, -10 );
 
 my $world = Box2D::b2World->new( $gravity, 1 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Box2D::b2Vec2> holds all of Box2D's 2 parameter lists;
most commonly the 2D vector and point.
It also provides some methods and overloaded operators
for manipulating vectors.
There are more functions that operate on C<b2Vec2>s found in L<Box2D::b2Math>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

 my $vec = Box2D::b2Vec2->new( $x, $y );

Returns a new C<Box2D::b2Vec2> with the specifed C<x> and C<y> components.

=head2 x

 my $x = $vec->x();
 $vec->x( $x );

Returns the vector's C<x> component.
Specify a single numeric value to modify it.

=head2 y

 my $y = $vec->y();
 $vec->y( $y );

Returns the vector's C<y> component.
Specify a single numeric value to modify it.

=head2 Set

 $vec->Set( $x, $y );

Sets the vector's components to those specified.

=head2 SetZero()

 $vec->SetZero();

Sets the vector's components both to zero.

=head2 IsValid

 my $is_valid = $vec->IsValid();

Returns true if both components are finite numbers. False otherwise.

=head2 Length

 my $length = $vec->Length();

Returns the length of the vector.

=head2 LengthSquared()

 my $length_squared = $vec->LengthSquared();

Returns the length of the vector squared.
For performance, use this instead of L</Length> (if possible).

=head2 Normalize

 my $length = $vec->Normalize();

Converts the vector into a unit vector.
Returns the length of the new vector.

=head2 Skew

 my $skew = $vec->Skew();
 
Returns the skew vector such that C<dot($skew, $other) == cross($vec, $other)>

=head1 OVERLOADED OPERATORS

=head2 +

=head2 +=

Vector addition of two vectors.

=head2 -

=head2 -=

Vector subtraction of two vectors.

=head2 unary -

Negation of the components of a vector.

=head2 *

=head2 *=

Scalar multiplication of a vector.

=head2 .

=head2 .=

Dot product of two vectors.

=head2 x

=head2 x=

Cross product of vector-vector, scalar-vector or vector-scalar.

=head2 abs

Absolute values of the compenents of a vector.
